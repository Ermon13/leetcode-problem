## README for LeetCode Solutions Repository

### Introduction
This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems. The goal is to practice problem-solving, algorithm design, and coding skills.

### Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

* **problem_category/**: Contains solutions grouped by problem category (e.g., arrays, linked lists, trees, dynamic programming).
    * **problem_name/**: Contains solutions for a specific problem.
        * `solution1.py`: Solution using approach 1.
        * `solution2.py`: Solution using approach 2.
        * `README.md`: Detailed explanation of the problem, solutions, and time/space complexity analysis.
* **algorithms/**: Contains implementations of common algorithms and data structures for reference.
* **tests/**: Contains unit tests for solutions (optional).

### Usage
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/leetcode-solutions.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the desired problem directory:**
   ```bash
   cd leetcode-solutions/problem_category/problem_name
   ```
3. **Run the solution:**
   ```bash
   python solution1.py
   ```

### Contributing
